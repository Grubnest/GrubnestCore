# GrubnestCore
The Core plugin for the Minecraft Minigame server, The Grubnest

## How to do work
1. Click the Projects tab above and find the project board for Grubnest Core
2. Look at the To-do column and find a task that is assigned to you
3. Find an epic task. Epic tasks are tasks that have several subtasks that you must complete. Start here
4. Complete your task. For an epic task, start here but for each separate task issue
5. Clone the development branch
5. Create a new branch off of the `development`branch you just cloned. If it's a bug, the branch name should start with "hotfix". If it's an enhancement it should start with "feature".
6. Make any changes you need to implement the issue
7. Create a Pull Request to merge your changes into the `development` branch.
8. Wait for your code to be approved. If you want to work on another issue in the meantime that requires work you did in this issue, when you make your new branch for the next task, make it off of the branch that is under review and not right off `development`. You can rebase the branch after it is merged.
9. If your code is reviewed and you're asked to make changes, ask questions and make them. Repeat steps 7-9 until your code is merged into `development`.

Follow all database and programming standards (to be posted) when working. For now, comment all methods, use descriptive variable names, and keep all database tables in BCNF (https://www.guru99.com/database-normalization.html).
